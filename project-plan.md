# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR GAME

## A. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM/ NEED

I want to create a rock-paper scissor game wherein my opponent is a computer and user must input the choice. Computer generates choice randomly while and user needs to type it in order to choose. The game will be played 5 times and record the stats after every game.
