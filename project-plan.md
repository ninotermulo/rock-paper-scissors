# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR GAME

## A. UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM/ NEED

I want to create a rock-paper scissor game wherein my opponent is a computer and user must input the choice. Computer generates choice randomly while and user needs to type it in order to choose. The game will be played 5 times and record the stats after every game.

## B. PLAN

1. The game doesn't have a user interface yet. So input typed by user is through prompt and every result will be seen in the console.

2. Only inputs that the program will have is from the user and computer. User input is through prompt and answer will be stored in a variable, while a computer generates randomly and store it also in a variable. I want the variable to be constant and will not change until it starts all over again.

3. The desired output is a 5-round game between the user and computer
